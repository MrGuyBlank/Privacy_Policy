Privacy Policy

1. Purpose

This Privacy Policy explains how GitHub Mastery Coach (“the GPT,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about what information is accessed and how it is used.

2. Information We Access

The GPT may access the following information when you connect it to GitHub or provide input during use:
	•	GitHub account data: Repository names, issues, pull requests, discussions, workflow metadata, and other project information made available through the GitHub API.
	•	Content you provide: Commands, questions, or error messages you share during conversations with the GPT.

The GPT does not independently collect or store personal data outside the platform.

3. Use of Information

Data is accessed only to perform the tasks you request, such as:
	•	Searching GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.
	•	Guiding you through Git/GitHub workflows.
	•	Creating issues in your repositories when you explicitly request it.

We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.

4. Authentication & Security
	•	Access to the GitHub API requires a personal access token (PAT) provided by you.
	•	Tokens are stored securely as secrets inside the GPT platform and are never visible to the developer.
	•	You can revoke access at any time by deleting your token in GitHub settings or removing it from the GPT secret manager.

5. Data Storage
	•	We do not store your GitHub data outside the GPT platform.
	•	We do not create databases, logs, or backups of your conversations or GitHub content.
	•	Any temporary data exists only within the GPT session and is discarded when the session ends.

6. Third-Party Services

The GPT may retrieve information from:
	•	GitHub (via the GitHub REST API).
	•	GitHub Community discussions.
	•	GitHub documentation (docs.github.com).
	•	Stack Overflow (public Q&A).

These services are governed by their own privacy policies.

7. Your Rights & Control
	•	You may revoke the GPT’s access to your GitHub account at any time.
	•	You may delete or rotate your GitHub personal access token at any time.
	•	You may stop using the GPT at any time.

8. Children’s Privacy

This service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from children.

9. Policy Updates
